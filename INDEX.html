        <h1>DO YOU WANT DOWNLOAD ARIUM FOR ALL VERSIONS</h1><br></br>
        <p> For those
            who are new to us, Arium is supported by simple and effective software solutions that
            will allow you to save a significant amount of time during a reinstallation.<br>
            
            Among these solutions, you will benefit from Arium Assist in which the essential information
            is to be defined in the pre-installation phase and thus no longer be polluted at the first start of the OS
            by the host of assistants as numerous as they are indigestible.<br>
            
            "Arium Features" will also convince you by selecting your strong post-installation choices
            such as the selection of the browser, the installation (or not) of the Windows store
            or even a selection of privacy profile adapted to everyone.<br>
            
            WITweaker, for its part, will allow you to quickly and efficiently configure Windows according
            to your requirements thanks to a carefully categorized arrangement of parameters.<br>
            
            Finally, Softs'Ium Update will take care of updating and monitoring the applications integrated into the system
            without any hassle.<br>
            
            As you will have understood, the guideline carried by the Arium team is to offer to the greatest number
            a refined, reliable, optimized and turnkey operating system"<br>
            
            Install:<br>
            
            1) Make a backup of your data (preferably on an external disk)<br>
            2) We recommend that you create a USB key with Ventoy (you just have to copy/paste the ISO into it).<br>
            3) When starting your PC, start on the USB key. (Esc, F9, F12 or other key at startup to
            change the boot order, or Bios configuration)<br>
            4) When you are on the disk configuration window, it is imperative to format/delete the
            partitions of your system disk!<br>
            
            By default, Windows prioritizes the use of compatible license keys.<br>
            
            However, if you do not have a license key, you can activate Arium by opening 'Arium Features' with an internet connection.<br>
            
            Click on "Windows" at the bottom left is not activated" (see screenshot #2) then on "Activate until 2038".<br>
            
            After a few moments, the message "Windows is activated" will confirm the correct activation of the OS.</p><br>
